# Data overview

The data in this spreadsheet was mostly used to match the precinct boundaries with election returns. In this repository we have

* `ohio_gen16_results.csv`: this has the 2016 general election results by precinct for every county in Ohio, including turnout data.
* `precincts_lookup_final.csv`: this has the matchings for the precinct names in both the shapefile and the election data for every county in Ohio (for which we've finished the pairings).
