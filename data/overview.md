# Data overview

The data in this spreadsheet was mostly used to match the precinct boundaries with election returns. In this repository we have

* `precincts_lookup_final.csv`: this has the matchings for the precinct names in the shapefile and election data for every county in Ohio (for which we've finished the pairings).
* `ohio_gen16_results.csv`: this has the 2016 general election results by precinct for every county in Ohio, including turnout data
